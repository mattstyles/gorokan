# Gorokan

Part of one game a month, January.

```
pnpm run dev
```

## Gameplay

Use the arrow keys to move your character around the world.

This is a sokoban clone, but rather than crates and positions we use food and creatures called Goros. Feed each Goro to win the level.

## Technical features

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) owns the UI
- [Valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio) handles global state
- The bulk of rendering is handled in a canvas element, using [Pixi](https://pixijs.com/) to do the heavy lifting
- Entity-Component-System is implemented using [BitECS](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/bitECS).
- Keyboard interactions are handled via [raid/streams](https://github.com/mattstyles/raid/tree/main/packages/streams).
- There is rudimentary event queue to handle mutations in the world.

## Thanks

Tile graphics are from [bountiful-bits](https://v3x3d.itch.io/bountiful-bits) and [bit-bonanza](https://v3x3d.itch.io/bit-bonanza). Thanks [\_V3X3D](https://twitter.com/_V3X3D).

## Notes

- The event queue is pretty rudimentary. As this is part of a one game a month challenge we wonâ€™t fix it here (as it works for this small scope) but it certainly needs work to generalise so it is scalable for applications with a larger scope.
- Need to investigate entry and exit queries within BitECS as there was a slight issue where new entities with the Renderable component were not registering in the entry query when other entities were also removed, meaning we could not assign them a Pixi sprite.
